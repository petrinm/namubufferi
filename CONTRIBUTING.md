## Code Style
Try to only commit linted, clean and readable code.

### Python: Django PEP8

### HTML/CSS/JS: Google Style

## Branching
No git-flow, use individual dev branches directly from master.
* master: Always in the most fresh working state.
* heroku: Always Heroku deployment ready.
* heroku-production: Deploys automatically to namupankki.herokuapp.com .

These are just how I've rolled with this, so you can suggest doing something else.
